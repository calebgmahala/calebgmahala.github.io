      <p>This was my very first project at Thaddeus Stevens and my first introduction to HTML. We learned the basics of HTML5 and how to open .html files in the browser

      <p>This is one of my most useful projects that I still use to this day. This project was made to teach us some more advanced CSS3 properties that we would then share to the class. This was by far my favorite project.

      </div>
      <p>This was the final project recreation for our front-end course/semester. Again, we worked in small teams to accomplish this project. My group did fenominaly on this project and where able to finish well before the deadline. All of the projects before this one prepared us, so my group had barely any difficulties. Even with the newly introduced javascript that we had been learning.

        <h3>Beer Pong</h3>
      </div>
      <p>As part of our front-end course, We where tasked with creating a javascript project in groups of two. Me and my buddy originally wanted to do pong in a browser, but I completed that project the day the project was assigned. My buddy and I then decided to make a two player beer pong game. This project took us a while, but is one of the projects I am most proud of. This is soley HTML, CSS, and javascript running in a browser. This game still has resolution issues that I have yet to fix.

      </div>
      <p>This was a website recreation that was designed by our professor. We worked in small teams simmulating a front-end project. This project was the first time we would use javascript. We learned javascript as we went and finished the project on time and well done. Me and my group had issues dividing up the work evenly so some people did not have as much work to do throughout the project. This taught us to plan on doing the difficult and neccisarry stuff first so people can alwase be busy.

        <h3>Electeams (Work in Progress)</h3>
      </div>
      <p>This was the big project for our third semester. We had to build a project that pulled well structured data from a custom api using our own well structured database. The app was supposed to show the data visually(graphs), and allowed for an admin portal and data accesing. Testing was mandatory and the api needed documentation. We where allowed to use our desired languages for the project.
      </p>
      <p>The project is a scheduling app designed more specifically for counter strike organizer(leagues). Users are on teams and the teams can play in tournaments or leagues run by organizations. Matches can be recorded and stats can be seen on your profile based on your matches with a specific team</p>
      <p>This project was built with a python(Flask) api pulling from a MySQL(Google Cloud) database. The backend is built with javascript(Express) and frontend templating is done with Mustache(js). Graphs are using Chart(js)</p>
      <p>I learned a lot from this project. Second semester was difficult for me and my class as we jumped through many languages(ruby, elixer, php) and did not get quality time with just one. This semester though, we where able to spend quality time on the languages of our choosing. I'm excited to have built my first backend project. I learned alot and even though I found lots of mistakes late in my project, I'm happy for this expierience as it has grown me as a developer</p>
